  
This SAMPLE_GRAMMARS file describes the sample grammars that come 
with the distribution, and provides an overview of how the grammars 
are organized.

Grammars written directly in the XML format used by OpenCCG appear in
separate directories under grammars/.  There are currently four small
English grammars -- tiny, worldcup, flights, and comic -- plus a series of
related grammars, mini-*, for Basque, Dyirbal, English, Inuit, Tagalog and
Turkish, which are from Bozsahin and Steedman's (2003) study of
ergativity. The worldcup grammar includes the English examples from
Baldridge (2002). (The Dutch, Turkish, Tagalog, and Toba Batak grammars
have not been updated from Grok version 0.6.) The flights and comic
grammars (used in the FLIGHTS and COMIC systems) make use of a shared
grammar of core English, in the core-en dir, and contain categories for
pitch accents and boundary tones.

Grammars written in the front-end CCG format, which attempts to provide a
more powerful and easier-to-use format than the raw XML, are in separate
directories under ccg-format-grammars/.  There are currently three grammars
here -- tiny, tinytiny, and arabic. `tiny' is a grammar originally based on
the `tiny' English grammar contained in the grammars/ directory and
documented above.  It has been significantly expanded so as to demonstrate
the various features of the CCG format.  `tinytiny' is a smaller English
grammar extracted from `tiny', which attempts to demonstrate a minimal-size
useful grammar. `arabic' is a grammar of a large chunk of Classical Arabic,
written by Ben Wing.  It was created in particular to demonstrate the power
of CCG-format macros in handling complex morphology, and contains a nearly
full grammar of Arabic verbs.

Note that work on extracting a broad coverage grammar from the CCGBank is 
in progress; at present, OpenCCG is best suited to limited domains, where 
coverage is not as large an issue.
