=========================================

Goal:

A: ``The story even the story such as it it was you know was kind of it's not
very inventive the bad guy turned out to con everybody just to get them
together blah blah blah that's kind of not exactly original is it really.''

B: ``It's too clean and tidy.''

A: ``I don't know whether the script was actually fairly kind of superficial
or whether the director just kind of skimmed over the top of it just to get
the action sequences out of it or something I don't know but there really
wasn't a lot to it I don't think.''

B: ``They certainly didn't spend any money on the script I don't think because
that was just terrible.''

A: ``The thing I did like though was the use of the kind of Moulin Rouge look
to it at the beginning when they were portraying Victorian England.''

B: ``It was colourful.''



Missing:

- "the bad guy turned out to con everybody just to get them together blah blah
  blah" (verbs with infinitival complements)
- contractions ("it's")
- coordination ("and", "or", "because", "but")
- "the director just kind of skimmed over the top of it just to get the action
  sequences out of it or something"
- subordination

Problematic:

- negation in a sentence ... Polarity has to be inverted ...
